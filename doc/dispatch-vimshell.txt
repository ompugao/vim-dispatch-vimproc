INTRODUCTION                                    *dispatch-vimshell*

Adds |vimshell.vim| strategy for |dispatch.vim| providing with a bunch of
features:

1. ANSI color support.
2. Allows using interactive commands (e.g. irb).
3. Allows sending SIGINT with <C-c>.
4. Shows command output while it's running.
5. A lot more that |vimshell.vim| allows to do.

STRATEGY                                      *dispatch-vimshell-strategy*

Vimshell ~

Can be used if you have |vimshell.vim| installed.  Foreground spawns new
unfocused vimshell buffer which shows you command output (almost) in real
time.  It is also possible to start interactive commands (e.g. irb) but
prefer using |:Start| for this.  Background builds are not supported.
