# dispatch-vimproc.vim

[vimproc](https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim) strategy for amazing [vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch).

## Installation

Use your preferred plugin installation method and install:

1. [vimproc.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim)
2. [vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) 

## Usage

Use it the same way you'd normally use vim-dispatch. vimproc is now the preferred strategy. Everything except to background builds is now supported. However, if vimproc is not loaded correctly (or you request background build), `:Dispatch` will continue to work correctly using built-in strategies.
